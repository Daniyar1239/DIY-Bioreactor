# DIY-Bioreactor

This is the first-year engineering project in the Electrical and Computer Engineering Department of Nazarbayev University. The project comprises the plastic jar as the body of a bioreactor, 3D-printed parts for the stirring mechanism and some electronics components attached to the Arduino board. The project aims to create an auspicious environment for yeast growth.

First, please see the final presentation of the project to understand the project's gist and some important details.
Second, see the the code implementation documentation.
Please, have a look into a simple program flow diagram, which summarizes the project.
You may watch the images and videos of our experiment and the results we've got, by opening the corresponding folders.
